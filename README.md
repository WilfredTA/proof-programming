# Proof Programming

This repository contains examples & exercises for programming proofs using the [Athena](http://proofcentral.org/athena/) proof language & interacting theorem proving environment.

These are used for both educational *and* experimental purposes. Many of the examples contained in here are adapted from examples in the book Fundamental Proof Methods in Computer Science. Some of the examples are also a result of my own experimentation or refactored versions of my solutions to exercises in FPMICS from the past.

Athena was invented by Konstantine Arkoudas at MIT where he put forth the notion of [Denotational Proof Languages](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/81531)
